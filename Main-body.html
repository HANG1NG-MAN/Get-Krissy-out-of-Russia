      <h1> Get Krissy out of Russia</h1>
      <h2> A crowdfunder to help a young trans artist to get out of a country dangerous to her.</h2>

      A site I made for my dear friend. Please help me with getting her out of Russia. It is a very dangerous place for transexual people, now more so than ever. 
      Any cent or peny counts! If everyone chimes in, we can save one person from a repressive regime threatening her life.

      <p>Who is Kristiana Hansen? </p>
      <p>A young, 22 year old trans woman living in Russia. Making her living with art, because working anywhere out in Russian society is simply not an option for her.
      You can see the examples of her comissioned furry art on her twitter. </p> 
      
      <p>What will the money go to?</p>
      <p>Kristiana has right now 5 dollars to her name and two days of food - she was not payed for one of her comissions for over a month. 
        A small portion of money will therefore go to food, medication and living bills, before the client who did not pay decides to be a decent human being.
