      <h1> Get Krissy out of Russia</h1>
      <h2> Any cent or peny counts! If everyone chimes in, we can save one person from a repressive regime threatening her life.</h2>

    <div>
      Welcome to a place for help, I made for my dear friend. Please help me with getting her out of Russia.
      It is a very dangerous place for transexual people, now more so than ever. 
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <p>Who is Kristiana Hansen? </p>
      <p>A young, 22 year old trans woman living in Russia. Making her living with digital art, because working anywhere out in Russian society is simply not an option for her.
      You can see the examples of her comissioned furry art on her twitter. </p> 
      
      <p>What will the money go to?</p>
      <p>Kristiana has right now 15 dollars to her name and two days of food - thanks to one of her comissions she was counting with for a month falling out. 
        A small portion of money will therefore go to food, medication and living bills, to cover a bit of time till next pay. 
        But most importantly: leaving Russia is no small bussiness. The expenses to cover: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> passport and buerocratic needs</li>
        <li> visa </li>
        <li> plane tickets </li>
        <li> moving costs for basic posessions </li>
      </ul>
